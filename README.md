# Let's simulate le Tour de France! 

This very [bodged](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIFE7h3m40U) simulator simulates Fluctuator in pre-modern. The decklist is tweakable and the ideal decklist will perform on an average turn 4 kill.

## Restless Dreams
We tried a Restless Dreams setup that could make you cycle away your Fluctuators (and possible Sideboard cards). We never found a consistent setup and believe it will brick you more often than it will benefit you.

## Sideboard cards
Notice that all sideboard cards are cyclers aswell. Having non-cycling cards in your deck is a debt in your combo turn and will cost you an average of 0.8 turn for the first card!
Whilst we thought about cards like Misdirection in the sideboard, adding in the playlist will put our average turn on about turn 7; which was unacceptable.

Whilst all the sideboard cards being cycling cards, they still cost you 'something'. Every non-creature cycler will cost you about 0.04 turns, and this number grows exponentially.
If needed, cutting some mainboard creatures for mainboard sideboard options to broaden your package is optional, but not free.

## Lands
The first Dromar's Cavern is always optimal. It is an extra untapped source to combo on turn or the turn you draw that as a second land. It also won't cost you a turn in most of your combo turns (The only time that is possible is if you are combo-ing after playing a untapped cycling land).
Playing the second Dromar's Cavern is worse than playing none at all, so stay at 1.

Exactly 20 tapped cycling lands is ideal in addition to the 4 untapped cycling lands and the Dromar's Cavern. Even if you had a theoretical 21st land, that would not gain you an average kill.

## Cyclers
While it doesn't really matter which Cycling Creatures you play, we advice to play as many 2 drops as you can. It is sub-optimal to ever play the 3rd land, because every cycler you remove from your hand will cost you a combo turn.
This also applies to your cycling creatures by the way; so there are almost no scenario's where you would play them. (In game one to beat a Tormod's Crypt or in a game where you drawn out a lot of cards to find the Fluctuator and need a blocker are acceptable examples)
